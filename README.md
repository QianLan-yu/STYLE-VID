## Comparison with other datasets
As analyzed in the paper, long-term Re-ID in video is closer to human awareness in real-world Re-ID scenarios. Moreover, the rich spatio-temporal information in video is helpful for long-term Re-ID. However, Research on long-term Re-ID in video is still in its infancy. To our knowledge, CCVID is the unique existing publicly available long-term video dataset. Nevertheless, the dataset size is fairly small and all videos are captured from a frontal perspective, which cannot satisfy our research on a generalized long-term Re-ID model.
